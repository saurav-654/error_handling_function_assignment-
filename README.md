# error_handling_function_assignment-





## Overview

The `ErrorHandling` contract is a basic Solidity contract designed to demonstrate different methods of error handling in Solidity. It allows users to deposit and withdraw funds from their personal balance using `require`, `assert`, and `revert` statements to handle insufficient balance errors.

## Features

- **Deposit Function**: Allows users to deposit an arbitrary amount to their balance.
- **Withdraw Functions**: Three different functions (`withdrawRequire`, `withdrawAssert`, `withdrawRevert`) are implemented to handle withdrawals using different error handling techniques.
